nonenumerative algorithms are known. Our first result shows that determining a shortest-length schedule in an 
m-machine flowshop is NP-complete for m ≥ 3. (For m = 2, there is an efficient algorithm for finding such schedules.) 
The second result shows that determining a minimum mean-flow-time schedule in an m-machine flowshop is NP-complete for 
every m ≥ 2. Finally we show that the shortest-length schedule problem for an m-machine jobshop is NP-complete for 
every m ≥ 2. Our results are strong in that they hold whether the problem size is measured by number of tasks, number 
of bits required to express the task lengths, or by the sum of the task lengths.},

times for the jobs are of various complexities then this impedes the learning process since processing times are one 
of the key features of JSSP and the interaction between processing times and will translate into the interaction 
between jobs. 

        
Yang2013 propose a general learning effect model for scheduling based on learning the processing times. They modelled 
learning patterns for processing time in scheduling, each based on a key feature of the scheduling process, e.g. sum 
of processing times ( which is the same information used in the traditional LWR and MWR dispatching rules)
